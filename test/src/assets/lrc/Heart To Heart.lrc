[00:00.00]Heart To Heart (诚恳的) - James Blunt (詹姆仕·布朗特)
[00:13.72]There are times when
[00:14.57]I don&apos;t know where I stand
[00:16.73](oh  sometimes)
[00:18.49]You make me feel like
[00:19.68]I&apos;m a boy and not a man
[00:22.40](oh  sometimes)
[00:24.54]
[00:25.69]There are times when
[00:26.46]You don&apos;t give me a smile
[00:28.61](oh  sometimes)
[00:30.32]I lie awake at night
[00:31.87]And worry for a while (oh  oh)
[00:36.77]
[00:37.73]It&apos;s OK &apos;cause I know
[00:40.65]You shine even on a rainy day and
[00:43.78]I can find your halo
[00:46.65]Guides me to wherever you fall
[00:51.13]
[00:52.83]If you need a hand to hold
[00:58.49]I&apos;ll come running  because
[01:01.05]You and I won&apos;t part till we die
[01:06.08]You should know
[01:09.41]We see eye to eye  heart to heart 
[01:13.64]
[01:25.68]There are times when
[01:26.60]I cry &apos;cause you shed no tears
[01:28.70](oh  sometimes)
[01:30.28]Your mind&apos;s so far away
[01:32.04]But your body&apos;s right here
[01:34.71](oh  sometimes)
[01:36.63]
[01:37.65]There are times when
[01:38.64]I just walked out your door
[01:40.62](oh  sometimes)
[01:42.80]And thought I&apos;d never get to see
[01:44.82]You anymore (oh  oh)
[01:48.90]
[01:49.86]It&apos;s OK &apos;cause I know
[01:52.57]You shine even on a rainy day
[01:55.53]And I can find your halo
[01:58.55]Guides me to wherever you fall
[02:04.71]If you need a hand to hold
[02:10.48]I&apos;ll come running  because
[02:13.14]You and I won&apos;t part till we die
[02:18.12]You should know
[02:21.27]We see eye to eye  heart to heart 
[02:25.84]
[02:26.48]Woah woah
[02:34.84]Oh sometimes
[02:36.40]
[02:37.35]Woah  woah
[02:46.43]
[02:48.39]Wherever you fall
[02:49.82]
[02:52.65]If you need a hand to hold
[02:58.50]I&apos;ll come running  because
[03:01.11]You and I won&apos;t part till we die
[03:06.07]You should know
[03:08.99]
[03:09.59]We see eye to eye  heart to heart 
[03:13.64]
[03:20.04]I can find your halo
